# Redbeansoup-bot

Actually, port of the Descalendrier website into a discord bot.

It uses the API created by [@JiveOff](https://github.com/jiveoff) to collect calendar data, and Discordeno lib as the bot framework.

## Run Bot

Make sure Deno is installed

```powershell
$ deno run -A --no-check mod.ts
```

If you don't want to copy paste the command above, you can also download pm2 and start the ecosystem file :

```powershell
$ pm2 start
```
